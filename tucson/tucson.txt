Tucson (working title)

(Verse 1)
In Tucson Arizona at the Jim Beam motel
I checked in on Thursday hurting like heck
With a bottle of burbon fitting it's name
What was I thinkin' you'd do the same

(Pre-Chorus)
Pretty white and in a line
We danced through the night
When the sun came up 
We all fell out and I held back your hair

(Chorus)
Christ I did love you
You were my angel in white
